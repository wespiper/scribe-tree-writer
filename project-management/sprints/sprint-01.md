# Sprint 1: Foundation - Test Infrastructure & Critical Tests

**Sprint Duration**: 2 weeks  
**Sprint Goal**: Establish test infrastructure and test our most critical educational features  
**Team Capacity**: TBD  

## Sprint Priorities

1. 🚨 **CRITICAL**: Set up test infrastructure (without this, nothing else can proceed)
2. 🚨 **CRITICAL**: Test reflection gates (our educational integrity depends on this)
3. 🚨 **CRITICAL**: Test Socratic AI boundaries (must never write content)

## Sprint Backlog

### Week 1: Infrastructure Setup

| Story | Points | Assignee | Status |
|-------|--------|----------|--------|
| [STORY-010](../stories/infrastructure/STORY-010-pytest-setup.md): Pytest Infrastructure | 5 | Dev | ✅ Completed |
| [STORY-011](../stories/infrastructure/STORY-011-jest-setup.md): Jest/Vitest Setup | 5 | Dev | ✅ Completed |

**Week 1 Goal**: Both test frameworks operational with example tests ✅

### Week 2: Critical Feature Testing

| Story | Points | Assignee | Status |
|-------|--------|----------|--------|
| [STORY-001](../stories/backend/STORY-001-reflection-gate-tests.md): Reflection Gate Tests | 8 | Dev | ✅ Completed |
| [STORY-002](../stories/backend/STORY-002-socratic-ai-tests.md): Socratic AI Tests | 13 | Dev | ✅ Completed |

**Week 2 Goal**: Core educational features have comprehensive test coverage ✅

## Total Story Points: 31 ✅ COMPLETED

## Sprint Ceremonies

- **Daily Standup**: 9:00 AM
- **Sprint Review**: End of Week 2
- **Sprint Retrospective**: After Review

## Definition of Done for Sprint

- [x] Pytest running with async support ✅
- [x] Jest/Vitest configured for React/TypeScript ✅
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline runs tests ⏳ (Moved to Sprint 2)
- [x] Reflection gate logic 100% tested ✅
- [x] Socratic AI boundaries 100% tested ✅
- [x] All pytest infrastructure tests passing ✅
- [x] Documentation updated (pytest & vitest) ✅

## Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Async testing complexity | Allocate extra time, pair programming |
| Unknown test infrastructure issues | Start with infrastructure stories first |
| Large story points (13) | Break down if needed, mob programming for complex parts |

## Technical Decisions

1. **Test Database**: Use separate test database with rollback after each test
2. **Mocking Strategy**: Mock external APIs (OpenAI/Anthropic) but use real database
3. **Coverage Target**: 80% minimum, 100% for critical paths

## Success Metrics

- ✅ 0 production code without tests (for new code) ✅
- ✅ 100% of reflection gate logic tested ✅
- ✅ 100% of Socratic boundaries tested ✅
- ✅ Test suite runs in < 2 minutes ✅
- ✅ 69 backend tests passing ✅
- ✅ 15 frontend tests passing (STORY-006 completed early) ✅

## Notes for Team

**Remember our mission**: We're not just writing tests. We're protecting our educational integrity. Every test you write ensures students develop their own thinking rather than getting a shortcut.

**TDD Workflow Reminder**:
1. Write a failing test
2. Write minimal code to pass
3. Refactor while keeping green
4. Commit frequently

**Critical Rule**: NO merging without tests. No exceptions. If you're stuck, ask for help rather than skip tests.

## Sprint 1 Retrospective

### What Went Well
- ✅ Successfully established TDD foundation with 100% coverage on critical educational features
- ✅ Reflection gates and Socratic AI boundaries fully tested
- ✅ STORY-006 (frontend tests) completed ahead of schedule
- ✅ All 69 backend tests passing
- ✅ ReflectionGate component: 97% test coverage

### What Could Be Improved
- CI/CD pipeline setup delayed to Sprint 2
- Need to expand test coverage on non-critical endpoints (auth: 67%, documents: 53%, analytics: 37%)

### Action Items for Sprint 2
1. Set up CI/CD pipeline to run tests automatically
2. Implement immutability refactoring (STORY-013)
3. Expand test coverage to meet targets

## Next Sprint Preview

Sprint 2 will focus on:
- ✅ Frontend component testing (reflection UI completed in Sprint 1)
- Beginning immutability refactors (STORY-013)
- Expanding test coverage to auth, documents, and analytics
- Setting up CI/CD pipeline
- Additional frontend component tests (AI chat, document editor)
