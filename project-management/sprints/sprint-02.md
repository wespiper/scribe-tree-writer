# Sprint 2: Immutability & Test Coverage Expansion

**Sprint Duration**: 2 weeks  
**Sprint Goal**: Implement immutable data patterns and expand test coverage to non-critical features  
**Team Capacity**: TBD  

## Sprint Priorities

1. **CRITICAL**: Implement immutability refactoring (technical debt from Sprint 1)
2. **HIGH**: Expand test coverage for authentication endpoints (67% â†’ 95%+)
3. **HIGH**: Expand test coverage for document management (53% â†’ 80%+)
4. **MEDIUM**: Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing

## Sprint Backlog

### Week 1: Immutability Refactoring & CI/CD

| Story | Points | Assignee | Status |
|-------|--------|----------|--------|
| [STORY-013](../stories/backend/STORY-013-document-immutable-refactor.md): Document Immutable Refactor | 5 | Dev | ðŸ”„ Ready |
| CI/CD Pipeline Setup | 3 | Dev | ðŸ”„ Ready |
| Authentication Test Expansion | 5 | Dev | ðŸ”„ Ready |

**Week 1 Goal**: Immutable patterns implemented, CI/CD running tests automatically

### Week 2: Test Coverage Expansion

| Story | Points | Assignee | Status |
|-------|--------|----------|--------|
| Document Management Tests | 5 | Dev | ðŸ“‹ Planned |
| Learning Analytics Tests | 5 | Dev | ðŸ“‹ Planned |
| Frontend: AI Chat Component Tests | 8 | Dev | ðŸ“‹ Planned |

**Week 2 Goal**: All backend endpoints have >80% test coverage

## Total Story Points: 31

## Definition of Done for Sprint

- [ ] All data mutations removed from backend
- [ ] Immutable update patterns implemented
- [ ] Authentication endpoints: 95%+ test coverage
- [ ] Document management: 80%+ test coverage
- [ ] Learning analytics: 80%+ test coverage
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline running all tests on PR
- [ ] All tests passing in < 3 minutes
- [ ] No new code without tests

## Technical Decisions

1. **Immutability Pattern**: Use Pydantic's `.copy()` with update for all model changes
2. **Test Strategy**: Focus on behavior and edge cases, not implementation
3. **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with PostgreSQL service container
4. **Coverage Reporting**: Integrate coverage reports into PR checks

## Success Metrics

- 0 data mutations in codebase
- Backend overall test coverage > 85%
- Frontend component test coverage > 90%
- All PRs run tests automatically
- Test suite remains under 3 minutes

## Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Immutability refactor breaks existing code | Write tests first, refactor incrementally |
| CI/CD setup complexity | Start with simple workflow, iterate |
| Test suite becomes slow | Parallelize tests, optimize database setup |

## Notes for Team

**Focus on Quality**: We're building the foundation for long-term maintainability. Every immutable pattern we implement makes the codebase more predictable and testable.

**TDD Continues**: Even though we're refactoring, write tests first for any new behavior.

## Next Sprint Preview

Sprint 3 will focus on:
- Frontend component testing (document editor, AI chat)
- Performance optimization
- Integration testing
- Security testing
