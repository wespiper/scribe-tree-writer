# EPIC-001: Test-Driven Development Implementation

**Priority**: ðŸš¨ CRITICAL
**Status**: Not Started
**Epic Owner**: TBD
**Target Completion**: Sprint 1-5

## Problem Statement

Our codebase has ZERO tests, violating the fundamental principle in CLAUDE.md: "Every single line of production code must be written in response to a failing test. No exceptions."

This is not just a technical issue - it's an educational integrity issue. Without tests, we can't guarantee our AI remains bounded and doesn't accidentally provide shortcuts to students.

## Goals

1. Establish comprehensive test infrastructure
2. Write tests for ALL existing functionality
3. Achieve 80%+ test coverage
4. Enforce TDD for all future development

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Backend test infrastructure operational (pytest + async)
- [ ] Frontend test infrastructure operational (Jest/Vitest)
- [ ] All critical educational features have tests
- [ ] Test coverage > 80%
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline runs all tests
- [ ] No code merged without tests

## Technical Approach

1. **Start with the most critical educational features**

   - Reflection gates (must enforce 50+ words)
   - Socratic AI (must never write content)

2. **Use real schemas in tests**

   - Import Pydantic models, don't mock
   - Use actual TypeScript types

3. **Test behavior, not implementation**
   - Focus on educational outcomes
   - Verify learning enhancement, not code structure

## Risks & Mitigation

| Risk                                 | Impact   | Mitigation                                  |
| ------------------------------------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Developers skip tests under pressure | Critical | Strict PR reviews, no exceptions            |
| Tests become maintenance burden      | High     | Focus on behavior tests, not implementation |
| False sense of security              | High     | Regular test quality reviews                |

## Dependencies

- None - this is the foundation everything else depends on

## Notes

Remember: TDD is how we ensure every feature truly enhances learning without creating shortcuts. When you write the test first, you're forced to think about what learning outcome you're trying to achieve.
