## Priority Levels

- 🚨 **CRITICAL**: Blocks all development (TDD violations)
- 🔴 **HIGH**: Major architectural issues (data mutations)
- 🟡 **MEDIUM**: Important but not blocking (linting setup)
- 🟢 **LOW**: Nice to have improvements

## Key Principles

1. **Test-First Development**: Every story MUST include test writing as the first task
2. **Small Iterations**: Break work into small, testable chunks
3. **Continuous Integration**: Each task should leave the codebase in a working state
4. **Educational Integrity**: All changes must support our core mission of enhancing student thinking

## Current Status

### 🎉 Sprint 1: COMPLETED

- **Duration**: 2 weeks
- **Story Points Completed**: 31 + 8 (STORY-006) = 39
- **Key Achievements**:
  - ✅ Test infrastructure established (Pytest + Vitest)
  - ✅ 100% test coverage on critical educational features
  - ✅ 69 backend tests passing
  - ✅ 15 frontend tests passing (ReflectionGate: 97% coverage)
  - ✅ STORY-006 completed ahead of schedule

### 🎉 Sprint 2: COMPLETED

- **Duration**: 2 weeks
- **Story Points Completed**: 20/31
- **Key Achievements**:
  - ✅ Immutable patterns implemented (STORY-013)
  - ✅ 113 total tests (+35 from Sprint 1)
  - ✅ Learning Analytics: 100% coverage
  - ✅ Immutable utilities: 100% coverage
  - ⚠️ Coverage tool limitations identified with async FastAPI
- **Deferred to Sprint 3**:
  - CI/CD Pipeline Setup
  - Frontend AI Chat Tests

### 🚀 Sprint 3: IN PLANNING

- **Focus**: CI/CD automation & frontend testing expansion
- **Key Stories**:
  - CI/CD Pipeline Setup (5 points) - carried over
  - Frontend AI Chat Tests (8 points) - carried over
  - Document Editor Tests (8 points)
  - Integration Test Suite (5 points)
- **Goals**:
  - Automate all testing on PRs
  - Expand frontend test coverage
  - Investigate coverage tool alternatives

### 📊 Test Coverage Status

| Reflection Gates    | 100%     | 100%     | 100%   | ✅     |
| Socratic AI         | 100%     | 100%     | 100%   | ✅     |
| Learning Analytics  | 37%      | 100%     | 80%+   | ✅     |
| Immutable Utils     | -        | 100%     | 100%   | ✅     |
| Authentication      | 67%      | 71%      | 95%+   | ⚠️     |
| Documents           | 53%      | 55%      | 80%+   | ⚠️     |
| ReflectionGate UI   | 97%      | 97%      | 90%+   | ✅     |
| **Overall Backend** | 65%      | 70%      | 85%+   | 🔄     |

**Note**: Coverage percentages for auth/documents affected by tool limitations with async code

## Getting Started

1. Review `ROADMAP.md` for the big picture
2. Check current sprint in `sprints/`
3. Pick a story from the current sprint
4. Follow TDD workflow: Red → Green → Refactor
