## Priority Levels

- ðŸš¨ **CRITICAL**: Blocks all development (TDD violations)
- ðŸ”´ **HIGH**: Major architectural issues (data mutations)
- ðŸŸ¡ **MEDIUM**: Important but not blocking (linting setup)
- ðŸŸ¢ **LOW**: Nice to have improvements

## Key Principles

1. **Test-First Development**: Every story MUST include test writing as the first task
2. **Small Iterations**: Break work into small, testable chunks
3. **Continuous Integration**: Each task should leave the codebase in a working state
4. **Educational Integrity**: All changes must support our core mission of enhancing student thinking

## Current Status

- **Total Epics**: 3
- **Total Stories**: TBD
- **Current Sprint**: Sprint 1 (Planning)

## Getting Started

1. Review `ROADMAP.md` for the big picture
2. Check current sprint in `sprints/`
3. Pick a story from the current sprint
4. Follow TDD workflow: Red â†’ Green â†’ Refactor
