## Priority Levels

- ðŸš¨ **CRITICAL**: Blocks all development (TDD violations)
- ðŸ”´ **HIGH**: Major architectural issues (data mutations)
- ðŸŸ¡ **MEDIUM**: Important but not blocking (linting setup)
- ðŸŸ¢ **LOW**: Nice to have improvements

## Key Principles

1. **Test-First Development**: Every story MUST include test writing as the first task
2. **Small Iterations**: Break work into small, testable chunks
3. **Continuous Integration**: Each task should leave the codebase in a working state
4. **Educational Integrity**: All changes must support our core mission of enhancing student thinking

## Current Status

### ðŸŽ‰ Sprint 1: COMPLETED
- **Duration**: 2 weeks
- **Story Points Completed**: 31 + 8 (STORY-006) = 39
- **Key Achievements**:
  - âœ… Test infrastructure established (Pytest + Vitest)
  - âœ… 100% test coverage on critical educational features
  - âœ… 69 backend tests passing
  - âœ… 15 frontend tests passing (ReflectionGate: 97% coverage)
  - âœ… STORY-006 completed ahead of schedule

### ðŸš€ Sprint 2: IN PLANNING
- **Focus**: Immutability refactoring & test coverage expansion
- **Key Stories**: 
  - STORY-013: Document Immutable Refactor (5 points)
  - Authentication test expansion (5 points)
  - Document management tests (5 points)
- **Goals**:
  - Remove all data mutations from backend
  - Achieve 85%+ overall backend test coverage
  - Set up CI/CD pipeline

### ðŸ“Š Test Coverage Status
| Component | Current | Target | Status |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|
| Reflection Gates | 100% | 100% | âœ… |
| Socratic AI | 100% | 100% | âœ… |
| Authentication | 67% | 95%+ | ðŸ”„ |
| Documents | 53% | 80%+ | ðŸ”„ |
| Analytics | 37% | 80%+ | ðŸ”„ |
| ReflectionGate UI | 97% | 90%+ | âœ… |

## Getting Started

1. Review `ROADMAP.md` for the big picture
2. Check current sprint in `sprints/`
3. Pick a story from the current sprint
4. Follow TDD workflow: Red â†’ Green â†’ Refactor
