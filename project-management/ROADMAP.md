# Scribe Tree Writer - Technical Debt Roadmap

## Executive Summary

Our codebase audit revealed critical violations of our core development principles, particularly the complete absence of tests. This roadmap outlines our path to full CLAUDE.md compliance.

## Phase 1: Critical Foundation (Sprint 1-2)
**Goal**: Establish test infrastructure and fix blocking issues

### Week 1-2: Test Infrastructure
- Set up pytest for backend with async support
- Configure Jest/Vitest for frontend
- Create test utilities and fixtures
- Write first tests for critical paths

### Week 3-4: Immutability Refactor
- Refactor all data mutations in backend
- Implement immutable update patterns
- Add tests for all refactored code

## Phase 2: Test Coverage (Sprint 3-5)
**Goal**: Achieve 80% test coverage using TDD

### Backend Testing Priority:
1. Reflection gate logic (education critical)
2. Socratic AI boundaries (must never write content)
3. Authentication/authorization
4. Document management
5. Analytics tracking

### Frontend Testing Priority:
1. Reflection submission flow
2. AI interaction components
3. Editor integration
4. Authentication flow
5. Document management UI

## Phase 3: Developer Experience (Sprint 6)
**Goal**: Smooth development workflow

### Linting & Formatting
- Frontend: ESLint + Prettier setup
- Backend: Ensure ruff/black automation
- Pre-commit hooks
- CI/CD pipeline with tests

## Success Metrics

- ✅ 0 production code without tests
- ✅ 0 data mutations
- ✅ 100% type safety (no `any`)
- ✅ All linters on save
- ✅ 80%+ test coverage
- ✅ All tests pass before merge

## Risk Mitigation

**Biggest Risk**: Writing code without tests during the transition
**Mitigation**: 
- Strict PR reviews
- No merge without tests
- Daily TDD check-ins
- Pair programming for complex features

## Timeline

- **Phase 1**: 4 weeks (MUST complete)
- **Phase 2**: 6 weeks (iterative)
- **Phase 3**: 2 weeks (polish)

Total: 12 weeks to full compliance

## Notes

Remember: We're not just fixing technical debt. We're ensuring every line of code serves our educational mission. TDD forces us to think about learning outcomes first, implementation second.
