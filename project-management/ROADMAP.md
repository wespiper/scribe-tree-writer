# Scribe Tree Writer - Technical Debt Roadmap

## Executive Summary

Our codebase audit revealed critical violations of our core development principles, particularly the complete absence of tests. This roadmap outlines our path to full CLAUDE.md compliance.

## Phase 1: Critical Foundation (Sprint 1-2) ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal**: Establish test infrastructure and fix blocking issues

### Week 1-2: Test Infrastructure ✅

- Set up pytest for backend with async support ✅
- Configure Jest/Vitest for frontend ✅
- Create test utilities and fixtures ✅
- Write first tests for critical paths ✅

### Week 3-4: Immutability Refactor ✅

- Refactor all data mutations in backend ✅
- Implement immutable update patterns ✅
- Add tests for all refactored code ✅

## Phase 2: Test Coverage (Sprint 3-5) 🏃 IN PROGRESS

**Goal**: Achieve 80% test coverage using TDD

### Sprint 3 Progress ✅ COMPLETE

- CI/CD Pipeline established ✅
- Frontend component testing expanded ✅
- E2E testing framework (Playwright) ✅
- Coverage tool investigation ✅

### Backend Testing Priority:

1. Reflection gate logic (education critical) ✅ 100% coverage
2. Socratic AI boundaries (must never write content) ✅ 100% coverage
3. Authentication/authorization ✅ 95%+ coverage
4. Document management ✅ 90%+ coverage
5. Analytics tracking ✅ 90%+ coverage

### Frontend Testing Priority:

1. Reflection submission flow ✅ Complete with E2E tests
2. AI interaction components ✅ 100% coverage
3. Editor integration ✅ Document Editor tests complete
4. Authentication flow ⏳ Basic tests, needs E2E
5. Document management UI ⏳ Needs testing

### Current Metrics:

- Backend: 113 tests
- Frontend: 46 tests (up from 0)
- E2E: 5 critical user journeys
- CI/CD: Running on all PRs

## Phase 3: Developer Experience (Sprint 6)

**Goal**: Smooth development workflow

### Linting & Formatting

- Frontend: ESLint + Prettier setup
- Backend: Ensure ruff/black automation
- Pre-commit hooks
- CI/CD pipeline with tests

## Success Metrics

- ✅ 0 production code without tests
- ✅ 0 data mutations
- ✅ 100% type safety (no `any`)
- ✅ All linters on save
- ✅ 80%+ test coverage
- ✅ All tests pass before merge

## Risk Mitigation

**Biggest Risk**: Writing code without tests during the transition
**Mitigation**:

- Strict PR reviews
- No merge without tests
- Daily TDD check-ins
- Pair programming for complex features

## Timeline

- **Phase 1**: 4 weeks ✅ COMPLETE (Sprint 1-2)
- **Phase 2**: 6 weeks 🏃 IN PROGRESS (Sprint 3 complete, Sprint 4-5 planned)
- **Phase 3**: 2 weeks 📋 PLANNED (Sprint 6)

Total: 12 weeks to full compliance (50% complete)

## Notes

Remember: We're not just fixing technical debt. We're ensuring every line of code serves our educational mission. TDD forces us to think about learning outcomes first, implementation second.
