## Using the Platform

### Why do I need to write a reflection before using the AI?

Reflections serve multiple purposes:

1. They help you clarify your own thinking before seeking help
2. They provide context for more relevant AI questions
3. They create a record of your thinking process
4. They ensure you're actively engaged in learning

### What makes a good reflection?

Good reflections:

- Explain what you're working on specifically
- Describe your current thinking or approach
- Identify specific challenges or questions
- Show genuine engagement with the topic
- Are at least 50 words long

### Why does the AI only ask questions?

Questions promote deeper thinking than answers. When you work through questions, you:

- Develop your own understanding

## AI and Learning

### Will the AI write my assignment for me?

No. The AI is specifically designed not to generate content. It only asks questions to help you develop your own ideas.

### How does the AI determine what questions to ask?

The AI considers:

- Your reflection content
- The context of your document
- Your reflection quality level
- Pedagogical best practices

### Can I trick the AI into giving me answers?

The AI has strong boundaries against providing direct answers or generating content. Attempting to circumvent these boundaries typically results in questions that redirect you to productive thinking.

### Does using this count as cheating?

No, because:

- The AI doesn't write content for you
- All AI interactions are transparent
- The tool develops your thinking skills
- Many educators encourage its use

Always check with your instructor about tool policies.

## Troubleshooting

### The AI says my reflection needs improvement. What should I do?

Try to:

- Add more specific details about your topic
- Explain your thinking process
- Include genuine questions you have
- Describe specific challenges you're facing

### My document won't save. What's wrong?

Check:

- Your internet connection
- Whether you're logged in
- Browser console for errors
- That you haven't exceeded storage limits

### The AI's questions don't seem relevant.

This might happen if:

- Your reflection is too vague
- You haven't provided enough context
- The topic is outside the AI's training

Try writing a more detailed reflection with specific examples.

### I can't log in to my account.

Try:

1. Resetting your password
2. Clearing browser cookies
3. Using a different browser
4. Contacting support if issues persist

## Educational Philosophy

### Why is this approach better for learning?

### How do I know I'm improving?
